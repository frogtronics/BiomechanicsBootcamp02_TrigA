Frog Force Data data from measurements of a frog jumping off of a force-measuring platform 'force plate':

col 1 time (s), unevenly sampled!!
col 2 resultant ground reaction force (N/kg-body mass)
col 3 horizontal ground reaction force component (N/kg-body mass)
col 4 vertical ground reaction force component (N/kg-body mass)

Data are from:

Marsh, RICHARD L., and HENRY B. John-Alder. "Jumping performance of hylid frogs measured with high-speed cine film." The Journal of experimental biology 188.1 (1994): 131-141.

The data were 'digitized' automatically using Engauge Digitizer freeware for turning images of graphs into data, given known scaling of the axes (http://digitizer.sourceforge.net/)
